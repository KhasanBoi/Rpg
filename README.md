# Rpg
asp.net web api
Rpg project has been built using asp.net web api. It has basic CRUD functionalities using Repository pattern. For Database, I used Postgresql with Pgadmin.
Moreover, ServiecResponse and Dtos have been added to modify the project. Also, we have authentication in our project, and JWT tokens were also added.
